 ## Pull Requests 
 
 Every PR should be reviewed and approved by someone other than the author, even if the author has write access. Fresh eyes can find problems that can hide in the open if you’ve been working on the code for a while.

To find the appropriate person feel free to play the [blame](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/) game. We all want to learn and help each other. In the comment section mention that person ```@username```. Then let the feedback and questions fly.
